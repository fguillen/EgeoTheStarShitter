# UnityAsync
UnityAsync is a coroutine framework for Unity built around the async API. This is not only a more efficient and effective replacement of Unity's IEnumerator coroutines, but also seamlessly integrates Unity with .NET 4+ asynchronous APIs.

With this library you can:
* Write allocation-free coroutines
* Seamlessly integrate with Task-based and async APIs
* Integrate with IEnumerator-based coroutines and YieldInstructions
* Easily switch sync contexts (main to background and vice-versa)
* Define your own custom await instructions (allocation free, no boxing!)
* Return results at the end of your coroutine
# Performance
Rest assured; UnityAsync coroutines will generally perform better than Unity's built-in coroutines because:
* They rarely cause heap allocations
* They don't weave in and out of native code
* They don't rely on a monolithic state machine

Comparing with standard `yield return null` update loops, performance is 150% improved. Uncached `WaitForSeconds` loops yield a performance increase of over 290%. The benchmarks included the time it took to instantiate the coroutines.

The one caveat is, in order to store the coroutine, a `Task` object must be allocated. A `Task` object is a bigger allocation compared to a `Coroutine` object. No way around it, if you want to integrate with `Task`-based APIs, you need to use `Tasks`. Often, you just need to fire the coroutine and forget about it, and in such cases, simply use `void` return type to avoid allocations altogether.

# Usage
## Installation
Clone the repo into your assets folder or download the [latest release](https://github.com/muckSponge/UnityAsync/releases/latest) and open the .unitypackage.

## Replacing existing coroutines
Let's say we want to replace a pretty straight-forward update loop `IEnumerator` coroutine:
```c#
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

...

IEnumerator UpdateLoop()
{
	while(true)
		yield return null;
}

void Start()
{
	StartCoroutine(UpdateLoop());
}

...

```
UnityAsync coroutines are defined by async methods, which can return `void`, `Task`, or `Task<TResult>`:
```c#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityAsync;

...

async void UpdateLoop()
{
	while(true)
		await new WaitForFrames(1);
}

void Start()
{
	UpdateLoop();
}

...
```
Easy-peasy, right? WaitForFrames is an `IAwaitInstruction`. When you await it, it spawns a `Continuation<T>`, which is (automatically) inserted into a queue and evaluated every frame until it is finished; in this case it will take one frame. Once finished, whatever is after the `IAwaitInstruction` is invoked. We could return `Task` instead of `void` if we wanted to store the coroutine for nesting.

If you want to link the lifetime of an async coroutine (or part of the coroutine) to a `UnityEngine.Object`, like the built-in `Coroutine`s do, see the ConfigureAwait section.

## Returning a result
Let's say we have some work we want to perform across the main thread, but it's too much to perform in a single frame. We can create a coroutine for this and return the result of the work once it is finished.
```c#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityAsync;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

...

async Task<int> GenerateResult()
{
	// contrived examples are the best examples, right?
	int result = 1;
	
	for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	{
		for(int j = 0; j < 100000; ++j)
			result = Mathf.Sin(result * j); 
			
		await new WaitForFrames(1);
	}
	
	return result;
}

async void Start()
{
	int result = await GenerateResult();

	// ...10 frames later
	Debug.Log(result);
}

...
```
We are awaiting the result in `Start()` so it needs to be an async method (this doesn't impact on how Unity calls it). We now return `Task<int>` and the result is available after 10 frames.

## Switching contexts
Sometimes you'll want to perform some task on the thread pool and return to the main thread once this is completed without blocking. This could be done via `Task.ConfigureAwait()` but now you can await directly on a `SynchronizationContext` which makes it super easy to swap back and forth:
```c#
using UnityAsync;

...

async void Start()
{
	// do some work on the thread pool
	await Await.BackgroundSyncContext();
	
	// ...
	
	// resume on the main thread
	await Await.UnitySyncContext();
	
	// update Transforms, etc.
}

...

```
`Await` actually contains many shortcut functions to streamline your code.

## ConfigureAwait
Just like with `Task`s, UnityAsync `IAwaitInstruction`s can be configured. You can set the scheduler (Update, LateUpdate, FixedUpdate) and also link its lifespan to a `UnityEngine.Object` and/or `CancellationToken`. Anything after the `await` line will not be reached if the `IAwaitInstruction`'s linked `UnityEngine.Object` was destroyed. If a cancellation was requested, an exception is thrown after the `await` line, which can be handled as you would when a `Task` is cancelled.
```c#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityAsync;

...

async void Start()
{
	// continuation will finish if:
	// - 10 seconds pass or
	// - this MonoBehaviour is destroyed
	// time is evaluated every fixed update
	await Await.Seconds(10).ConfigureAwait(this, FrameScheduler.FixedUpdate);
	
	// ... if the calling MonoBehaviour was destroyed, we won't get this far
	// if it is still alive, we'll be in FixedUpdate
	
	var c = new CancellationSource(100);
	
	try
	{
		await Await.Seconds(10).ConfigureAwait(c.Token);
	}
	catch(OperationCancelledException)
	{
		// exception will be caught here after 100ms
	}
}

...

```

## Yielding a task
You may run into a situation where some of your coroutine code is async, but it is called from an `IEnumerator`. In such a situation you can use `Task.AsYieldInstruction` or `Task<TResult>.AsYieldInstruction`.
```c#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityAsync;

...

IEnumerator Start()
{
	yield return new WaitForSeconds(1);
	
	Debug.Log("Click to continue...");
	
	yield return WaitForMouse().AsYieldInstruction();
	
	Debug.Log("Click!");
}

async Task WaitForMouse()
{
	await Await.Until(() => Input.GetMouseDown(0));
}

...

```

# Await instructions / awaitables
Built-in:
* `WaitForFrames`
* `WaitForSeconds`
* `WaitForSecondsRealtime`
* `WaitUntil`<sup>1</sup>
* `WaitWhile`<sup>1</sup>

Unity:
* `IEnumerator`<sup>2</sup>
* `YieldInstruction`<sup>2</sup>
* `AsyncOperation`
* `ResourceRequest`<sup>3</sup>

Others:
* `Task`
* `Task<>`
* â€¦anything that implements `GetAwaiter()`

<sup>1</sup>Use the generic variants to pass a state object and avoid closures.

<sup>2</sup>Will spin up a Unity `Coroutine`, causing allocations. Note, `CustomYieldInstruction` implements `IEnumerator`.

<sup>3</sup>Very small delegate allocation.

Anything that implements `IAwaitInstruction` can be awaited and will be evaluated in Update, LateUpdate, or FixedUpdate. This is how the built-in await instructions are implemented. The advantage over `Task`s or `CustomYieldInstruction`s is they don't cause any allocations if implemented as structs.
# Custom await instructions
You can implement your own await instructions by implementing `IAwaitInstruction`.
```c#
public interface IAwaitInstruction
{
	bool IsCompleted();
}
```
It's dead simple, just place your behaviour in `IsCompleted` and return `true` when your criteria are met. `IsCompleted` will be evaluated every frame (depending on the `FrameScheduler`). Use a struct to avoid unnecessary allocations.

One more thing to note; `GetAwaiter()` is already provided through an extension method so that the instruction can encapsulate itself in an `AwaitInstructionAwaiter` when awaited. It is this struct which actually ends up being awaited - as a kind of decoration to make custom await instructions more straight-forward to implement (the alternative is inheritance which causes heap allocations).

```c#
using UnityAsync;

public struct WaitForTimeSpan : IAwaitInstruction
{
	readonly float finishTime;

	bool IAwaitInstruction.IsCompleted() => AsyncManager.currentTime >= finishTime;
	
	public WaitForFrames(TimeSpan timeSpan)
	{
		// we use AsyncManager.currentTime here (and above) because it's slightly more efficient vs Time.time
		finishFrame = AsyncManager.currentTime + (float)timeSpan.TotalSeconds;
	}	
}
```

# Usage with Unity EditorTests (unit tests with NUnit)
When running unit tests, `AsyncManager` is not automatically initialized. Call `AsyncManager.InitializeForEditorTests()` in your test OneTimeSetUp method, for example like this:

```c#
// In your test class

[OneTimeSetUp]
public void OneTimeSetUp()
{
	AsyncManager.InitializeForEditorTests();

	// Other setup code here
}
```
